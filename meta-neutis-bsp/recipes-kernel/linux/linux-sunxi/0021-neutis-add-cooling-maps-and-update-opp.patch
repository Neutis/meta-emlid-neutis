Subject: [PATCH 2/3] arm64: allwinner: neutis: remove unused property from the
 CPU node

The "cooling-min-level" and "cooling-max-level" properties are not
parsed by any part of the kernel currently and the max cooling state of
a CPU cooling device is found by referring to the cpufreq table instead.

Subject: [PATCH 3/3] arm64: allwinner: neutis: add cooling-maps

For regulating device performance, which is known as passive
cooling. A typical passive cooling is a CPU that has dynamic voltage and
frequency scaling (DVFS), and uses lower frequencies as cooling states.
