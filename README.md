meta-iota
==============
Emlid Iota board based on allwinner H5 SoC.

This layer depends on the additional layer:
- meta-sunxi from `https://github.com/AD-Aleksandrov`
- meta-openembedded

Tested with iota-image, core-image-base.

Copy `bblayers.conf.sample` and `bblayers.conf.sample` from `meta-iota-distro/conf` to build directory
